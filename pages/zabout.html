    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>I am currently a sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
      I have taken many challenging courses in computer science, including Programming Languages and Techniques I-III, 
      Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science, Introduction to Computer Systems, and Scalable and Cloud Computing.<br>
      Currently, I am in Programming Techniques III, CIS 121, which discusses data structures and algorithms, including BSTs, heaps, 
      balanced search trees, tries, Huffman coding, and HashTables. <br>
      Another class I'm in, Scalable and Cloud Computing, NETS 212, is about programming in the "cloud," and how we can scale projects
      up and down to accomodate large numbers of users. <br>
      I plan on graduating after four years with a Bachelors of Science and Engineering, with a major in computer science,
      and minors in math and data science. <br>
