        <p>Hi, my name is Neil Shweky and I am an undergraduate student in The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at The University of Pennsylvania. 
            I live for logic, math, and computer programming. As such, I am an app developer, using languages such as Objective-C, Java, and Node.js, and have already posted several apps on the App Store.
            I am most interested in backend development however, and live for building servers, creating APIs, and using NoSQL databases.

            However, this does not leave me with a completely sedentary lifestyle. In my free time I like to play guitar and many sports, including baseball, football and hockey. I also like to volunteer for many community service events, namely by the charity organization Sephardic Bikur Holim, for whom I have and continue to volunteer my time in creating and maintaining two of their apps. </p>

    The languages I'm proficient in:
