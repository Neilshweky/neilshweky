      <h2 class="sbhy-h1">SBH Youth App</h2>
      <div class="apps-div">
        <img class="screenshot" src="../images/sbhys.png">
        <p class="pright"> 
            This is the second app I built for Sephardi Bikur Holim, however this app was build for the youth division.<br>
            SBH Youth App is an app that provides an events schedule for SBH's Youth division's upcoming events. 
            The app also provides an attendance system and awards community service hours to those that attend said events. 
            The app also provides a "buddy" system so users can see which events their buddies are going to.<br>
            As the lead developer, I stored and queried large sets of data in Firebase databases, while managing hundreds of users. 
            I also used Node.js to build a server and a private API for the app, which I used to send notifications and aid with the buddy system.<br>
            You can find some statistics on the app <a href="http://sbhyouthapp.herokuapp.com">here</a> including how many hours were done through the app.
            This app was so fun for me to build and distribute because it actually made a difference in the lives of many.
            It's really amazing to see how much volunteer work I contributed to only through my coding skills.

      <h2 class="sbhc-h1">SBH Captain's Guide</h2>
    <div class="apps-div">
      <img class="screenshot-right" src="../images/sbhcs.png">
      <p class="pleft">
          I built an app for Sephardic Bikur Holim (SBH), a charity organization for the Syrian Jewish community in Brooklyn.
<br>
          This app helps Captains, those in charge of helping their respective clients, 
          keep track of all of Sephardic Bikur Holimâ€™s various programs so they can correctly and efficiently devise a plan to help their clients as best as possible.
          <br>
          This app communicates with a cloud-based NoSQL database to pull all of its data, and also to send push notifications whenever an update occurs.

    <h2 class="a100b-h1">100 Berachot Counter</h2>
    <div class="apps-div">
      <img class="screenshot" src="../images/100bs.png">
      <p class="pright"> 
        This is 100 Berachot Counter. 
          The purpose of this app is to aid the everyday Jew in their attempts to make 100 blessings (berachot) per day. 
          It is a commandment of Jews to say 100 blessings everyday, and this app helps them keep track of the blessings they said that day, while also offering the text of those blessings.
        <br>
          This app offers a sleek and easy-to-use design, 
          to help the average Jew more easily reach the goal of 100 blessings in a day. 
          This app also takes the date into account, and it changes the available blessings to check off based on the day. For example, the blessing on the moon will only be available during the middle of the lunar month, i.e. when there is a full moon, etc.

    <h2 class="gcs-h1">Geometry Cheat Sheet (PRO)</h2>
    <div class="apps-div">
      <img class="screenshot-right" src="../images/gcss.png">
      <p class="pleft">
        This is Geometry Cheat Sheet. GCS is the first app that I built, and was when I really
        decided to get serious in Mobile App Development.<br>
        Geometry Cheat Sheet is an application that allows people to calculate many formulas, 
        without having to do the math required. All one needs to do is input the numbers on the given
        page and the app will do the rest. <br>
        The app can calculate many things including circles, rectangles, triangles, spheres, right circular cylinders, 
        right circular cones, pyramids, mean, median, and mode, exponents/square roots, 
        linear equations (distance, midpoint, and slope formulas), quadratic Formula, logs, law of sines/law of cosines, 
        and radians to degrees conversions/degrees to radians conversions.
